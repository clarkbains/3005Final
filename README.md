# Book Store Application 

## About

## Running
This project is containerized for easy use. With `docker-compose` installed and `docker` started, copy the `docker-compose-example.yml` file to `docker-compose.yml`, then simply run `docker-compose up --build` to build and start the project.
This configuration will expose a working frontend server on [localhost:9757](https://localhost:9757)

## Deployed Version
A deployed version of the frontend is available at [3005fe.cbains.ca](https://3005fe.cbains.ca), and a backend at [3005be.cbains.ca](https://3005be.cbains.ca). The database here is inaccessible to the public.
